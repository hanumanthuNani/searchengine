# Dynamic Search Engine by Nani

This is a simple **Dynamic Search Engine** built using the **Google Custom Search API**. It allows users to search for information directly from your website and view the results in a beautifully designed interface. This project uses **HTML**, **CSS (Tailwind)**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Search Engine Interface**: A modern, dynamic search interface with a **dark theme**.
- **Google Custom Search API**: Integrates Googleâ€™s powerful search capabilities using an API key and Search Engine ID.
- **Loading Animation**: A clean and smooth loading spinner while fetching results.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring the website looks great on all screen sizes.
- **Styled Results**: The search results are presented with beautiful hover effects and proper spacing.
  
## How It Works

1. Users enter a search query in the provided search box.
2. When the "Search" button is clicked, the input is sent to the Google Custom Search API.
3. The results are fetched and displayed on the same page without redirecting.
4. The page includes a **loading spinner** to indicate the status of the search query.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For building the structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for a responsive, sleek, and modern design.
- **JavaScript**: For interacting with the Google Custom Search API and fetching results dynamically.
